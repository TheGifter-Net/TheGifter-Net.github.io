## Nominate a Fellow SWer For a Gift

In addition to randomly sending at least one gift a month to a follower, I will also occasionally send out gifts to fellow cam models / SWers nominated by my followers.

To be eligible for nomination, your fellow cam model or SWer must have an active public Twitter account and either an Amazon wishlist or an email address for receiving gift cards. As the nominator, **you must be following [TheGifter](https://twitter.com/TheGifter) on Twitter**. The nominee does not need to be following the account to be eligible.

To nominate someone, please send an email with the subject containing "Gift Nomination" to thegifter@thegifter.net. Please include the following:

* Your Twitter username.
* The nominee's Twitter username.
* A brief explanation of why you believe the nominee deserves to receive a gift. At least a sentence. No more than 4-5 sentences.
* Whether you want to nominate anonymously or by name.

**Only one submission per follower per calendar month**.

At least one nominee will be chosen every month from the nominees collected in the previous month. For example: sometime in May a model will be chosen who was nominated in April.
