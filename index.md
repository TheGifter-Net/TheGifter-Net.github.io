## Frequently Asked Questions

### What do I need to do to be eligible to receive a gift?

You must be a cam model or SWer. You must follow [@TheGifter](https://twitter.com/TheGifter) on Twitter. One of two things must be easily found from viewing your Twitter profile:

* An Amazon Wishlist setup to receive gifts
* An email address for receiving Amazon gift cards

If you are outside of the US, please make it clear that you prefer, for example, Amazon Canada gift cards.

### What do you expect in return?

Nothing. In fact, I ask that you **_not_** reciprocate by sending me videos or other content. This is a gift. If you want to show your appreciation, it'd be great if you could simply tweet your appreciation to raise awareness of the account and help your fellow models / SWers get a chance of being spoiled as well.

### Why are you doing this?

I like making people smile from small gifts. I've supported SWers and their services over the years, and I just wanted to do something fun to build a following while spoiling my followers.
