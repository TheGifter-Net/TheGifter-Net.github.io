## Frequently Asked Questions

### What do I need to do to be eligible to receive a gift?

You must be a cam model or SWer. You must follow [@TheGifter](https://twitter.com/TheGifter) on Twitter. One of a few things must be easily found from viewing your Twitter profile or via your linked MFC, ManyVids, etc profile:

* An Amazon Wishlist setup to receive gifts
* An email address for receiving Amazon or other brands of gift cards
* Another means of sending you gifts (such as a PO Box)

If you are outside of the US, please make it clear that you prefer, for example, Amazon Canada gift cards.

### What do you expect in return?

Nothing. In fact, I ask that you **_not_** reciprocate by sending me videos or other content. This is a gift. If you want to show your appreciation, it'd be great if you could simply tweet your appreciation to raise awareness of the account and help your fellow models / SWers get a chance of being spoiled as well. You may also consider [nominating](/nominate) your fellow SWers to receive a gift.

### Why are you doing this?

I like making people smile from small gifts. I've supported SWers and their services over the years, and I just wanted to do something fun to build a following while spoiling my followers.

### Can I nominate another model / SWer to receive a gift?

Yes! Every month I will send at least one gift to a random follower and one gift to a SWer nominated by a follower. [See details about nominating your friends](/nominate).

### Send _me_ a gift!

This isn't a question :)  Gifts are sent randomly or as a result of [nomination](/nominate). If you demand a gift, you probably won't ever get one. I am not into financial domination, etc. That's not to say that I won't spoil SWers who happen to offer financial domination, but I am not seeking it. Demands will only decrease your odds of receiving spoils.
